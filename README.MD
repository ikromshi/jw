# Project Readme


## About the project
All the code for the project resides inside the **transactions.py** file.
The program is written to process a CSV file(s) of transactions for an employee or multiple employees and generate a corresponding CSV file that sums up the records for a given month strictly following the format specified in the [assignment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jPLjyPXsjze6fnODEr6XYfPKfC979zzP/edit#gid=456907284).

## How to run the program
**transactions.py** can be run via Python Launcher if accessed through Finder or File Explorer. It can also be run via the Terminal, or a Code Editor/IDE.
<br><br>
The project already has the provided CSV files in the directory, so entering the CSV filename will suffice to see the program run. If there is a need to test the functionality of the program with more CSV files, adding them to the same directory as **transactions.py** and entering their paths/names to the input prompt will be enough to see the program run.
